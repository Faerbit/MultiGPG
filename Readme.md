#MultiGPG

This is a simple script that handles modifying the contents of a GPG encrypted archive.

Execute multigpg --help to see the usage of this script.

Please do not change the extensions of the created files. The script relies on it.

Please do not test the script with the provided test script and use it to handle sensitive data at the same time. Data loss can occur!

Please note that this is very WIP and doesn't work at the moment.
